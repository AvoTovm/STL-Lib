# Custom STL Library 🚀  

This repository contains my custom implementation of various **Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms** in C++. It serves as a learning experience and a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of data structures, templates, and efficient C++ programming.  

## 🌟 Features  

✅ **Template-Based Implementations** – Supports generic programming.  
✅ **Header-Only Design** – No separate compilation required.  
✅ **STL-Like Interface** – Mimics the behavior of standard C++ containers.  
✅ **Efficient Data Structures** – Optimized for performance.  

## 📂 Implementations  

| Container/Algorithm | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Vector**         | Dynamic array implementation. |
| **List**          | Doubly linked list with bidirectional iteration. |
| **Set (AVL-based)** | Ordered set implemented using an **AVL Tree**. |
| **Stack**         | LIFO structure with push, pop, and top operations. |
| **Queue**         | FIFO structure with enqueue and dequeue support. |

## 📌 Usage  

To use any data structure, simply include the corresponding header file in your project:  

```cpp
#include "include/my_vector.h"  // Example for vector
#include "include/my_set.h"     // Example for set
```
